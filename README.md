# poetry-language-model
This code was used to train RNN-based subword language models for the 2019 National Poetry Day in Hungary.
To generate your own poems, click [here](http://oddnumberofeyes.com/versgenerator/)!
This repository contains:
* the [data](https://github.com/ben0it8/poetry-language-model/tree/master/data) used for training the models (one corpi for each poet),
* end-to-end training scripts (Jupyter Notebooks)
* web application in Flask, which was deployed on [Heroku](https://poetry-day.herokuapp.com/)


To train the models I used [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) and the free GPU runtime.
